| Ruby      |               | none            |               |

### Solution

* the 'Hardway' folder is example work from
* http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/
* I have not rigidly followed the book - some examples use more advanced ideas or syntax, or simplify the output

### To do

* As these are exercises not a priority to clean up

### Learning points

* Learning Ruby the Hard way a bit slow, but working the free-form exercises very useful
* Probably a good idea not to follow this course rigidly, as can learn quicker from Chris Pine
